This file should not be manually modified and is intentionally empty.

Upon compilation/ assembly of OS, this directory is used to hold binary files.
These files allow the creation of the OS ISO file, which can be run using 
command '$ ./run'. The 'run' bash script file is hidden as '.run' when not
active (i.e. OS not compiled and assembled, this file empty).

DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE.
