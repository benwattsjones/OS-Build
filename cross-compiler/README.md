This directory is where to install the cross compiler, so it is automatically
detected and used by the Makefile. Instructions on how to build the cross
compiler are present in the main README.

You may install the cross compiler in a different directory, but this will
require you to modify the Makefile (specifically the line beginning `CC =`).
