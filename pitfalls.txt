This file is a list of basic issues and bugs come accross during the development
of the OS. It is not comprehensive, but is hoped to help avoid such issues 
agian.

1. No hardware interupts will fire.
        When initializing the GDT in the bootloader, "cli" was called. "sti"
        thus must be called after interrupts are initialized.

2. Only one hardware interrupt will fire.
        The interrupt handlers need to begin __asm__("cli"); and end 
        __asm__("sti");.

3. Arrays do not work.
        Using a cross compiler solved this issue.

4. The OS triple faults as soon as paging is enabled (or identity mapping 
   unmapped).
        The GDT must be redefined after paging is enabled, as interrupts rely
        on knowledge of segmentation from the GDT, but the GDTR address needs
        to be updated from a physical to a virtual one.

5. General wierd behaviour.
        Not enough pages loaded by BIOS 'int 13' call.

6. The OS page faults after delay once paging is enabled.
        The stack was set using uninitialized bss segment to region where
        page was not present.

7. No cursor on last line visible.
        The cursor will not be visible if the line is filled with zeros. Thus 
        when clearing the final line upon scroll-down, use spaces instead.

8. Unexpected software interrupts.
        Mixup of hex and dec caused hardware interrupt handlers to be 
        initialised to wrong interrupt numbers.

9. Bootloader freezes when too many sectors loaded using INT 0x13.
        This was caused by loading the kernel code before the
        bootloader. Specifically, the bootloader is at 0x7x00 whereas
        the kernel was loaded from 0x1000 - thus overwriting it on the
        55th page. Another cause for this issue would be if pages were
        loaded accross a cylinder (hense should load one at a time) or
        if more than 128 pages were loaded at a time, though both of
        these reasons should permit the printing of an error message.
