DEPENDENCIES:

While the iso file that results from assembly/compilation is an operating
system, and thus OS independent, the process of building it has only been 
tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm qemu
possibly for making gcc compile in 32-bit mode:
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib

GOALS:
* Make OS boot from partitioned USB, with part of USB used for storage

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

Create the .iso file with command:
$ make
This will make bin directory with binary files, .iso file containing OS, and
run file for running OS in qemu emulator
Run the operating system in the qemu emulator with command:
$ ./run 
Remove the binary files (placed in bin directory) and .iso file with command:
$ make clean
